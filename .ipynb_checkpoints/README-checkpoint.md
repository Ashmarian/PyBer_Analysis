# PyBer_Analysis
Overview of the analysis:
Using Python skills and knowledge of Pandas to create a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type.
The purpose is to deliver a visualization of the total weekly fares for each city type: Rural, Suburban and Urban.

Results:
Urban cities have the highest number of total fares over time, Suburban cities have the second highest fares and rural cities have the lowest fares. This may be an indication of the the amount of people that use ride-sharing services. People may use ride-sharing services more in Urban cities due to more activities and probably because they may not have another method of transportaion. 
People in urban cities may lower fares in Urban cities despite more use. People pay an average of $24.53 per ride. 
It was interesting to see that there are only 78 drivers in Rural cities. This is why the fares are so expensive. There is not enough drivers to meet the demand of passengers in rural cities. 

Summary:
I rcommend that the CEO concentrate on ride-sharing services in Urban areas and prehaps find data on average wait times for riders to have a selected driver. With this data, the buisness can focus on lowering wait times. 
Furthermore, the CEO could expand the ride-sharing business to suburban areas and market discounts or credits for rides into more urban areas. If prices are lowered, maybe more people are likely to use the ride-sharing service. 
Finally, more drivers need to be added to both suburban cities and rural cities to increase availability to passengers living in these two types of cities.
